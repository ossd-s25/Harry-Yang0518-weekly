## Week 3

## Our extension: Currency-Unit-Converter

We wanted to create a simple yet funtional converter that: 
1. Supports currency, lenght and weight conversions.
2. Fetches real-time currency rates.
3. Has a user-friendly UI with dropdowns and input field.

The extention contains popup.html for UI, popup.js for ligic, manifest.json for manifest, and icon.png and readme file.

The interface was developed by using HTML and CSS, and the manifest contains the necessary permissions and configurations.

In the popup.js, we have three features:
1. fetching real-time exchange rates: Using an API to get live currency conversation rates.
2. Handling conversations for length and weight: Using predefined conversations factors.
3. Populating dropdowns dynamically: Ensuringthe right units show up to based on the selected type.

## What's Next

In the future, we can impove UI for better user experience and also plan to suppore more unit types.
