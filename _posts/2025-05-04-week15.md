##  Update – HF Datasets Docs Contribution

This week, I updated my pull request [#7532](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/7532) to improve the Hugging Face Datasets documentation related to cache management.

### What I worked on

* Clarified the role of the `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` environment variable, which was previously undocumented

<!--more-->
* Explained the difference between:

  * `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`: for datasets cache (e.g., Arrow files)
  * `HF_HUB_CACHE`: for model/tokenizer/raw dataset downloads from the Hub
  * `HF_HOME`: a parent variable that controls both subdirectories
* Provided real-world examples and configurations for environments with shared file systems like NFS
* Integrated feedback from [#7480](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/7480) to ensure the docs reflect actual behavior and user expectations
* Added an inline section directly under the existing `HF_HOME` docs to preserve structure and clarity

### Why it matters

Many users (myself included) were confused when setting `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` didn’t affect the Hub cache location. This distinction is important in large-scale or multi-user environments where caching strategy can significantly impact performance, I/O, and disk usage.
