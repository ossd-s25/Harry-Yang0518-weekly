## Reflections on My Small Contributions

I have made small but meaningful contributions to OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia. Whenever I notice issues in areas I’m familiar with, I try to resolve them or leave comments to help improve accuracy. Additionally, I contribute by adding Chinese translations to Wikipedia pages and enriching existing content with relevant information.

## Challenges I Encountered
One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding an open-source project that aligned with my coding skills. My previous experience has been centered around developing small-scale products from the ground up—going from zero to one. However, contributing to open-source projects requires a different approach: building upon existing work and taking things from 50 to 100.

This shift has been challenging but also valuable. It has helped me develop the ability to read and understand large codebases while meeting project requirements set by others. Unlike school projects, where I had full control over development, open-source contributions require collaboration and adaptability. I believe these skills will be crucial for my future career.

## A Contribution I’m Proud Of
One of my most satisfying contributions was improving information about a major expressway in China on Wikipedia. This expressway runs from north to south, passing through my hometown, Beijing. On Wikipedia, the page lacked details about the entry and exit points for each province along the route.

To address this, I researched the official Chinese website of the expressway, translated the information into English, and updated the Wikipedia page. This contribution benefits foreign travelers driving in China, helping them better plan their routes. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for those interested in transportation infrastructure, providing more comprehensive details about China's road network.
